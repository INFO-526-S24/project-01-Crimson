Given that stock prices embody a convergence of market sentiment and company performance, delving into this dataset promises valuable insights. Analyzing the trends and drivers within it empowers investors to make well-informed decisions.\nThe dataset itself is well-structured, comprising two tables. One table provides essential information such as date, open, and close, while the other details the associated company names.\nSpanning nearly a decade, this dataset offers a unique vantage point to observe trends from the post-financial crisis era to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to create impactful visualizations for the top 14 big tech companies, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of how the tech industry has been perceived in the market during this significant timeframe.\nIn essence, our engagement with this dataset transcends mere technical considerations; it extends to encompass analytical aspects, enabling us to make well-informed decisions within the confines of the provided data."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nWe will be employing the following approaches to address the questions posed.\n\nApproach for question 1\nThe inquiry involves examining the impact of the pandemic on stock prices within a specific time-frame. To achieve this, we focus on key features: “dates” (to identify the pandemic period) and “stock price” (utilizing adj_close). The “Pandemic Period” is defined as starting from the year 2020, enabling us to assess stock prices during this particular time-frame. Calculations include determining the average returns within this period, as well as 3- and 5-year returns, along with their respective peak prices. This approach offers a comprehensive overview of the overall impact on a company’s stock price.\nFor our plot, we plan to use the x-axis and y-axis as follows:\nX-axis: Time (period): Plotted chronologically to illustrate the progression during the pandemic period. Each point on the x-axis corresponds to a specific period within this time-frameååå.\nY-axis: Returns- Utilized for plotting.\nFacets and colors will be employed to differentiate between the top big tech companies with the highest and lowest impact in terms of returns.\nThis visualization can be achieved using geom_line() , geom_col() and annotations can be added using geom_text()\n\n\nApproach for question 2\nTo analyze trends in stock prices across different companies, we will explore two dimensions: weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) and Financial Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4).\nUtilizing day-wise data, we plan to visualize weekdays using the weekdays() function from base R. Additionally, we will augment our dataset with an additional column for year and quarter to facilitate more granular analysis. The aggregation of stock prices will involve calculating averages for high, low, and adj_close during the specified periods.\nOur visualization strategy may involve using geom_box() or geom_line() to determine the most effective representation. To enhance clarity, facets and colors will be employed to distinguish between companies and periods of interest.\nThis approach is expected to yield valuable insights into stock price trends, allowing us to uncover patterns related to both weekdays and financial quarters."
