## Decade-Long Data Trends

### Crisis to Pandemic

::: incremental
-   Analyzing economic shifts post-financial crisis
-   Identifying patterns leading to market volatility
-   Impact of COVID-19 on global financial markets
-   Exploring resilience and recovery strategies
:::

## Question 1: Which companies have experienced the highest/lowest impact on their stock prices due to the pandemic?

First Plot

::: incremental
-   Drop in stock prices in H1 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic
-   Adobe , Netflix showed significant drop in stock prices during 2020-2023
-   Tesla showed highest increase during 2020-2023
-   Tesla stock prices increase in due to EV sales- release of new models/ Green Subsidy Push
-   Reasons for stock price drop in 2022 - slowdown in sales, recession fears, increase in unemployment rate etc.
:::

Second plot ( Detrended plots )-

::: incremental
-   Most of the stocks show stock price ratio deviations in last 3 years 2020-2022
-   Telsa shows above normal growth during period 2020-2022
-   Adobe/Netflix shows increase initially but then fall below line during 2020-2022
:::

Third plot (Average Stock Price Returns Per Year) for period (2018-2019) and (2018-2022)

::: incremental
-   Microsoft had highest returns over 2 years 46.46% (39.55% over 5 years)

## Tables(Extra slide- needs to be removed)

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Images(Extra slide- needs to be removed)

## Math Expressions(Extra slide- needs to be removed) {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

## Feeling adventurous?(Extra slide- needs to be removed)

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
